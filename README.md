# Scheduled Appointment Booking App

Become a Scheduler or Booker and see appointments you have booked or have been booked with you. This software allows for the experience of both sides of the app, depending on which account you create.

## Scheduler

The business side of the Scheduler app that allows a user to set up their business, the services they offer and the times they are available for booking. Once the account is set up and business is made, all the details will be shown on the dashboard and the business will be listed for Bookers to see.

## Booker

Once a Booker account is created, you will be able to start booking appointments with any of the Schedulers that have set up their business. There will be a section on the dashboard that lists all businesses. Once an appointment has been booked, the information can be viewed on the dashboard.
